    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are the simplest pancakes to make with kids. You don’t even need scales to weigh out the ingredients – all you need is a cup or a mug!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large free-range egg</li>
        <li>1 cup of self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Optional</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>200g Blueberries</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons natural yoghurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the batter, crack the egg into a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, milk and a tiny pinch of sea salt.</li>
        <li>Whisk everything together until you have a lovely, smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Fold through the blueberries, if using.</li>
        <li>Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and after a minute or so, add ½ tablespoon of oil.</li>
        <li>Carefully tilt the pan to spread the oil out evenly.</li>
        <li>Add a few ladles of batter to the pan, leaving enough space between each one so they have room to spread out slightly – each ladleful will make one pancake, and you’ll need to cook them in batches.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes, or until little bubbles appear on the surface and the bases are golden, then use a fish slice to carefully flip them over.</li>
        <li>When the pancakes are golden on both sides, use a fish slice to transfer the pancakes to a plate.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 5 to 9 with the remaining batter, adding ½ tablespoon of oil to the pan between batches, if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes straight away, topped with a dollop of natural yoghurt, and some extra berries, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
